# Northwind Traders: Strategic Sales & Supply Chain Audit

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Data Integrity
The goal of this phase was to establish a robust SQL environment and ensure data consistency across the Northwind schema.

### Steps Taken:
- **Database Engine:** MySQL 
- **Schema Standardization:** Renamed tables to `snake_case` (e.g., `order_details`) for easier querying.
- **Verification:** Confirmed 830 orders, 91 customers, and 77 products are correctly loaded.
- **ERD Mapping:** Identified core relationships between Suppliers, Products, and Orders.

Audit Type                                       Finding                                                        Impact on Strategy
Date Integrity                     no records found with ShippedDate < OrderDate                  "Leads to true ""Fast Shipping"" metrics."
Price Audit                          no records found with $0 Unit Price                       Represents no potential revenue leakage or unrecorded promos.
Missing Data                        507 orders missing Region data                                     Makes geographic sales analysis incomplete.

### Strategic Classification & Action Plan

| Quadrant | Category | SQL-Based Evidence | Business Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stars** | Beverages, Dairy | High Revenue + High AOV (> $750) | **Invest:** Priority stock allocation and premium marketing. |
| **Question Marks** | Meat/Poultry, Produce | High AOV (> $770) but Low Volume | **Promote:** Launch cross-selling campaigns to increase order frequency. |
| **Cash Cows** | Confections, Seafood | High Volume but lower AOV | **Optimize:** Maintain sales while reducing logistics/handling costs. |
| **Dogs** | Grains/Cereals | Low Volume + Low AOV (< $550) | **Review:** Re-evaluate supplier contracts or consider bundling. |


## Phase 3: Strategic Sales Analysis

### 1. Product Category Performance
**Question:** Which product categories are driving the most revenue?

**Findings:**
- **Beverages** and **Dairy Products** account for nearly 40% of total company revenue.
- **Meat/Poultry** maintains the highest Average Order Value (AOV), indicating a high-margin premium segment.

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Increase inventory investment in high-turnover Beverages while launching a targeted "Premium Bundle" campaign for Meat/Poultry to capitalize on the high AOV.



## Phase 4: Supply Chain Efficiency Audit

### Logistics Performance by Category
**Objective:** Identify if high-revenue categories are suffering from shipping delays.

**Key Findings:**
- **[Insert Category Name]** has the highest late shipping rate at **[Insert %]**.
- Our "Cash Cow" (Beverages) has a late rate of **[Insert %]**, which is **[above/below]** the company average.

**Strategic Impact:**
Logistics bottlenecks in high-volume categories like Beverages suggest that our current shipping partners may be overwhelmed.
To protect our primary revenue stream, we should consider renegotiating SLAs with shippers for these specific product lines.

### 2. Supply Chain & Logistics Audit
**Question:** Are our top-performing categories suffering from delivery delays?

| Category | Late Rate | Business Priority | Audit Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grains/Cereals** | 6.04% | Low | Worst performance; operational bottleneck. |
| **Dairy Products** | 5.94% | **CRITICAL** | High perishable risk; requires immediate logistics review. |
| **Beverages** | 5.08% | **HIGH** | Affects the most customers; 18 orders delayed. |
| **Confections** | 3.73% | Medium | **Best in Class;** analyze for internal best practices. |

**Audit Conclusion:** There is a negative correlation between product value and shipping reliability in the Dairy category.
We recommend a "Carrier Audit" for all Dairy and Beverage shipments to reduce the late rate to under 4%.



## Executive Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations

Based on the 2024 Northwind Strategic Audit, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Immediate Logistics Intervention:** The **Dairy** category is at "Critical Risk" due to high revenue volume and a 5.9% late shipping rate for perishables.
2. **Revenue Protection:** **Beverages** should be prioritized for "Premium Shipping" tiers to protect the $267k annual revenue stream.
3. **Operational Cleanup:** **Grains/Cereals** should be reviewed for potential discontinuation or bundling to simplify supply chain complexity.
