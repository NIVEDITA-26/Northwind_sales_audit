# Northwind Traders: Strategic Sales & Supply Chain Audit

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Data Integrity
The goal of this phase was to establish a robust SQL environment and ensure data consistency across the Northwind schema.

### Steps Taken:
- **Database Engine:** MySQL 
- **Schema Standardization:** Renamed tables to `snake_case` (e.g., `order_details`) for easier querying.
- **Verification:** Confirmed 830 orders, 91 customers, and 77 products are correctly loaded.
- **ERD Mapping:** Identified core relationships between Suppliers, Products, and Orders.
